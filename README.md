# Vue draggable/swipable app drawer
A drawer menu for your Vue app that supports native-like swipe gestures.


## Installation
I haven't quite figured out yet how to publish to NPM, so feel free to fork this repo and use my components in your own project.

## To-do
- Convert to NPM module
- Back button support with Vue Router
- Add support for props (drawer width, swipe speed threshold, overlay color/opacity, drawer transition speed)
